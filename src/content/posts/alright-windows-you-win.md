I am a defender of open-source projects. Sadly, it isn't everyone's philosophy. Bummer. And, well, whatever.

One thing we are daily driving is our computer; and its operating system. And so, three paths opens to you:

- Will you use the most popular operating system, the most user-friendly (so to say), most recognized, and the one you're the most likely to be the most experienced with? But, don't forget your [entry ticket](<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-11-pro/dg7gmgf0d8h4>)!
- Have you paid the Apple tax? If so, welcome to your new [privacy-invading](<https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html>) home. (There's a lot you should read in that book)
- Do you feel adventurous, traveler? Do you wish to explore Linux, and its open world? The greatest place of freedom known to technology, but will you dare challenge its step learning curve? But fear not, it's all free for you to explore this wonderful landscape.

Okay, you actually only have *two paths*, assuming you haven't paid the Apple tax. And if you have, you're unlikely to use any other OS anyway.
And obviously, almost everyone uses Windows these days.

And I've been there too. I've used Windows as my daily drive too. It has been a fair ride, with struggles at time, most especially for programming. It quickly become easy to understand that programming on Linux is only a fair (and sometime sane) decision.

So I've decided to run Linux for some times.

## My experience with Linux

To reiterate, I have two computers:

1. My "main" computer, a desktop, with a quite solid configuration.
2. My secondary computer, a laptop, with trembling performances and a doubtful price tag. (it wasn't cheap, the b*tch.)

### How it began

Back when I switched to Linux, I began it all with my laptop. I wiped Windows from the drive, and replaced it with [Fedora 39](https://fedoraproject.org/). I started with the GNOME windows manager.

The experience was pleasant, everything felt smooth, I had experience with Linux, I know how to deal with a terminal, to mess and toy around with stuff and enjoy a quite joyful experience.
This is quite how GNOME feel in a single word: joyful. It's simple, easy, straight up clean.

But in my personal opinion, it is missing tools, options, tweaks, you would be used to on a MacOS or Windows... And being "dependant" of user-maintained plugins quite irritate me a little. It show how lacking can it be.

And so I tried **KDE**. Luckily for me (Or fearfully), KDE version 6 released quite recently after I decide to make the switch.
While the refreshed desktop experience really made its charm, it also came with a few bugs that got patched a few weeks/months later, so I didn't mind it too much. I understand it can't be perfect.

And that's as far as how I've configured my Linux environment. KDE for it all. It was quite good, but... KDE also come with its quirks.
While KDE came with plentiful of tools, options/settings, tiny details and way more full of features (That's, again, in **my opinion**), there's probably TOO MUCH of them! Some feels like they've been unmaintained for years, and glitches are quite common in KDE.

Additionally, while less required than GNOME, tons of aspect of KDE can be customized using... user-submitted content. And those "plugins" are way, *WAY* less maintained than the KDE ones.
So maybe I should have stayed the GNOME way. Go figure.

#### Breakage

Now, as I said, I was using Fedora 39. What it pretty much want to sum up as is: "Be a good OS for a computer that is loved for general purposes users".
And so, to ensure quality, packages are generally manually reviewed by Fedora's contributors, to avoid huge breakages.

So here's the pretty much what made me seal the nail of the coffin of leaving it behind.

- A kernel update of Linux made my laptop flash and stay stuck on a black screen after waking up from sleep, forcing to reboot the laptop. Which is a HUGE bummer for a laptop. It stayed so for ~1 month.
- A KDE update made the taskbar absolutely unusable. It stayed so ~2 months.
- Dual booting for gaming is... Not fun. Steam will update OS specific games/library every time you boot on a different OS since last time, quite beating the purpose of dual booting.
- I play a few very specific games, which will never run on Linux.
- Updates are sometime really slow and annoying. While I do appreciate the up to date distro, it's a way more violent schedule than Windows (Almost... every two days?). So, Windows users, stop complaining. Seriously. :p

And so, since I was quite unamused for these different points, most especially focused on gaming, it's about time to just... use Windows for a gaming computer!

All hail this damn OS!

### Something that left a bitter taste with my current dual boot Windows at the time

So I wanted to switch to Windows. Sure, why not. So my goal was to **clear entirely the drives, and install a new Windows**. Destructive? Indeed!
I could have just deleted Linux (Which used 100Go, when I gave it like... 400Go iirc), and claimed back the free space for the Windows partition.

The thing was that I was using a "customized" Windows, using a modification called "[AtlasOS](https://atlasos.net/)".

As I mentioned in my [2024 review](2024-in-review/index.md):

> [...] While I appreciate the modification realized to Windows and the increase of privacy, the modification it provides are cause more troubles than help.

AtlasOS has this bad habit to apparently entirely cut off Windows Update. Not the very basics one such as Microsoft Defender antivirus database (thank god!), or to oil up the current version of Windows. But anything about *upgrading* was out of the question apparently.
And yes, that is to me, an issue. What if I want to mess with the brand new [Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/welcome-to-copilot-on-windows-675708af-8c16-4675-afeb-85a5a476ccb0)? (eww)
<!-- Lol, I can't wait for that URL to die! -->

And secondly. Whenever the AtlasOS team went out to release an AtlasOS update (So pretty much their scripts to "tweak" Windows), it would generally require **a whole OS reinstall**!

And that, my friends, is an absolute ***no***. Upgrading shouldn't impact user's documents.

So throw me this out the Windows! We'll just use tools to tweak Windows yourself!

## Going back Windows style
