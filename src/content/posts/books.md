As surprising as it may sound, I'm not much of a reader usually. I just happen to read stuff by pure curiosity, not because "Oh, this look interesting." when I'm at the library.

I generally won't read something that just _catch my eyes_, I need a much stronger reason for me to push myself to read something. And it's a spark of interest either by a topic, or a reference I've seen somewhere else.

To read my books, I generally use my [Boox Note Air 4C](<https://euroshop.boox.com/products/noteair4c>) tablet, it allows me much greater flexibility than carrying books in my bag (Which already weight a bit). I could read stuff everywhere this way without taking too much space (It's super thin!)

> ⭐⭐☁️☁️☁️ -> TL;DR A good and interesting read overall, but way too focused in sexual topics. The social theme is also an important part of this book, leaving the reader to understand more about division of relationship. However, it goes much more unnoticed sadly due to the uninteresting sexual scenes.

I have been given this book from my high-school English teacher, which gave it saying it reminded her of me (but that I shouldn't see a message in this present). Sure!

So I gave this book a read, entirely. I heard a little later that it received a TV show, which... I'm thankful I haven't seen from what I could hear about it. So, I jumped into the reading absolutely not knowing I'll read, but I think my teacher was a bit wrong about my case.

The book begins by introducing the 2 main character of this book, a boy and a girl who are in the same school. The girl is part of a rich family, and the boy from a less wealthy family. Both will get to know each others and things will go on. They'll often get to lose each others, and meet again. This pattern of "losing-finding" keeps on repeating a lot in the book, which is no issues at all due to the context of the story, most especially since chapters are separated with long period of time in the story.

The main problem I had with the book is that it focus way too much on sexual topics. Almost every chapters has its sexual scene. And that BOTHER ME SO MUCH!
I'm not asexual, that's not the point, but in my personal opinion, I don't find the need to describe a lot what is happening in bed, which was very recurrent.

I could understand why it was necessary however, because it'll cover the topic of BDSM (kids, don't look it up on Google) and how one can feel loved. Still, it makes the topic of social relationship goes way more unnoticed than I wish.

If the sexual scenes were less present, I would have probably liked this book way more.

> ⭐⭐⭐⭐☁️ -> TL;DR Shorts series mixed with horror, fiction and romantic stories. A book full of sensational stories you probably won't find anywhere else.

This book is a very repetitive occurrence in the game [Signalis](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalis>), it's how I learned about this book. My interest was piqued after playing the game. For reference, it's a horror game.

I really like this book, and I have yet to finish it, but I will still give it a review here.

It is packed with different little stories with different kind of endings, but still follow a certain pattern. The story will either be a happy ending, or a bad ending, but, it'll be because of something they all share in commons. Will you guess what?

In here, you'll have different emotions: Hate, love, horror, etc.

I really like how the supernaturals events that happens are happening naturally. It feels like it isn't even supernatural and part of our daily world. Thankfully not, but it feel crazy realistic.
Kudos to the quotes that were made between stories too, I really enjoy them.

It's overall an amazing read if you like adventure and dramatic lectures. It won't kill your sanity, and you'll have a hell of a fun ride!
