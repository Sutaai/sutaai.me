# About me

I am called Sutaai online. It comes from the Japanese of "Star eye" (スターアイ).
Visit <https://sutaai.dev/> for more links.

I am a french female resident. I work in the field of system administration and networking maintenance for public services.
I have past experience with programming which is now more of a personal hobby than anything serious.
Call me a nerd, you'd be deadly right.

Privacy is one of the thing I am really close yet still very not knowledgeable about.
I try to still allow myself to use tools that are not privacy-friendly (Such as [Gemini](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Gemini)) for the sake of features that I consider personally important or that would be too restricting for myself and my usages (Like [Screen Calling](https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387) on my phone, which is a feature I absolutely can't lose).
I am looking forward to use [Signal](https://signal.org/) for my daily messaging.

I will make a blog post once this happen.
