# About me

I am called Sutaai online. It comes from the Japanese of "Star eye" (スターアイ).
Visit <https://sutaai.dev/> for more links.

I am a french female resident. I work in the field of system administration and networking maintenance for public services.
I have past experience with programming which is now more of a personal hobby than anything serious.
Call me a nerd, you'd be deadly right.

Privacy is one of the thing I am really close yet still not very knowledgeable about.
Over the years, I've been more and more forcing my hand to use privacy-friendly solutions and de-googling my life, which does take a lot of time, practice and patience, but it is a process that is by far the most gratifying.
I am looking forward to use [Signal](https://signal.org/) for my daily messaging.
